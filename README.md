My name is Adel and I am a Computer Science student in University of Toronto 📚💻

I have deployed AI infrastructure at Palantir, Amazon, IBM, Cisco and a few exciting startups. I am currently researching ML compilers, and previously done research in speculative decoding. Additionally, I took part in the Google Summer of Code under the mentorship of Google DeepMind, contributing open source to the largest AI evaluations framework.
